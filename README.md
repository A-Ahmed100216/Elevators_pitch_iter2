## The Pitch
Hello, my name is Aminah Ahmed and I recently graduated with a Master's in Aerospace Engineering.
Although I enjoyed my studies in Aerospace, I discovered my true passion lies in technolgy.  
This passion was piqued through attending an event at university wherein I was introduced
to a range of IN4.0 Topics such as Cloud Computing, AI and Automations.
Upon graduation, i enrolled into an academy which
gave me the foundational knowledge in topics such as Cloud Computing. 
It was through this; I was given the opportunity to work with a client and deliver a research project on the       
topics of data capture, analytics and visualisation. This project proved to be an invaluable experience and        
a resounding success with the client very impressed with the project outcome. Furthermore, I during my time at 
the academy, I successfully gained an AWS Certification as an AWS Cloud Practitioner. These experiences
led me to pursuing a career in technology and consulting as I discovered that I enjoyed both working with clients
and delivering technical projects. Hence, I conducted some research and came across DevOps.
I was drawn to this subject as it focusses on topics, I had briefly covered previously but I did not get the chance
to fully explore. I was pleased to learn that Sparta Global provides us with full training because I may not have
the strongest background in this field, but I am a fast learner.
