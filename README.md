## The Pitch
Hello, my name is Aminah Ahmed and i recently graduated with a Master's in Aerospace Engineering.
You may be wondering how I found myself pursuing a career in DevOps. Well, during university
I attended an event which introduced me to a range of IN4.0 Topics such as Cloud Computing, AI and Automations.
This really sparked my interest in the technology sector so upon graduation, i enrolled into an academy which
gave me the foundational knowledge in topics such as Cloud Computing. Though this,I was able to get an AWS certific$
and i knew i wanted to pursue a career in the technology sector so i did some research and came across DevOps.
I was drawn to this subject as it focusses on topics i had briefly covered previosly but I did not get the chance
to fully explore. I was pleased to learn that Sparta Global prvides us with full training becasue I may not have
the strongest background in this field, but i am a fast learner.
